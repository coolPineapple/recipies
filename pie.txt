How to make banana pie:
	INGREDIENTS
		1> Condensed milk
		2> cracker crumbs
		3> butter
		4> bananas
		5> whipped cream
		6> vanilla extracts

		Directions
		
		 Step 1
			To make banana pie, place the unopened can of sweetened condensed milk in
			a saucepan, and add enough water to cover half-way up the can. Place the
			saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cook for 3 hours,
			adding more water as necessary. Remove from heat and cool.

		 Step 2
			Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

		 Step 3
			Combine the graham cracker crumbs with the butter in a mixing bowl until
			evenly blended. Press the crumb mixture evenly into a 9 inch pie plate.

		 Step 4
			Bake pie crust in preheated oven until lightly browned, 10-15 minutes.
			Remove from oven, and cool on a wire rack.

		 Step 5
			Open the can of dulce de leche, and pour half, or about 3/4 cup, over the
			pie crust. Slice the bananas and arrange half in a layer over the dulce de
			leche filling. Pour the remaining dulce de leche over the bananas. Top with
			remaining banana slices.

		 Step 6
			Pour the whipping cream into a mixing bowl, and beat until soft peaks form.
			Add the sugar and vanilla extract; continue beating until stiff peaks form.
			Spoon the whipped cream over the bananas. Chill at least 1 hour before serving.
